## Description
This game was created with pure javascript and offers mobile support! All art assets used in this project were provided by "https://bevouliin.com/" please feel free to checkout any other art assets offered on the website. The sprite images available are great for projects such as this. The concept of the game is fairly simple, jump over the enemies that approach the player to increase your score! Will be working on other versions of the game to make it more competitive for the player. Any help is always welcome, and if you would like to contribute to this game feel free to contact me via any of the links in the contact section.
